For example, `Date` represents a value by returning a unix\n   * timestamp for `valueOf`:\n   *\n   *     var date1 = new Date(1234567890000); // Fri Feb 13 2009 ...\n   *     var date2 = new Date(1234567890000);\n   *     date1.valueOf(); // 1234567890000\n   *     assert( date1 !== date2 );\n   *     assert( Immutable.is( date1, date2 ) );\n   *\n   * Note: overriding `valueOf` may have other implications if you use this object\n   * where JavaScript expects a primitive, such as implicit string coercion.\n   *\n   * For more complex types, especially collections, implementing `valueOf` may\n   * not be performant. An alternative is to implement `equals` and `hashCode`.\n   *\n   * `equals` takes another object, presumably of similar type, and returns true\n   * if the it is equal. Equality is symmetrical, so the same result should be\n   * returned if this and the argument are flipped.\n   *\n   *     assert( a.equals(b) === b.equals(a) );\n   *\n   * `hashCode` returns a 32bit integer number representing the object which will\n   * be used to determine how to store the value object in a Map or Set. You must\n   * provide both or neither methods, one must not exist without the other.\n   *\n   * Also, an important relationship between these methods must be upheld: if two\n   * values are equal, they *must* return the same hashCode. If the values are not\n   * equal, they might have the same hashCode; this is called a hash collision,\n   * and while undesirable for performance reasons, it is acceptable.\n   *\n   *     if (a.equals(b)) {\n   *       assert( a.hashCode() === b.hashCode() );\n   *     }\n   *\n   * All Immutable collections implement `equals` and `hashCode`.\n   *\n   */\n  function is(valueA, valueB) {\n    if (valueA === valueB || (valueA !== valueA && valueB !== valueB)) {\n      return true;\n    }\n    if (!valueA || !valueB) {\n      return false;\n    }\n    if (typeof valueA.valueOf === 'function' &&\n        typeof valueB.valueOf === 'function') {\n      valueA = valueA.valueOf();\n      valueB = valueB.valueOf();\n      if (valueA === valueB || (valueA !== valueA && valueB !== valueB)) {\n        return true;\n      }\n      if (!valueA || !valueB) {\n        return false;\n      }\n    }\n    if (typeof valueA.equals === 'function' &&\n        typeof valueB.equals === 'function' &&\n        valueA.equals(valueB)) {\n      return true;\n    }\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  function deepEqual(a, b) {\n    if (a === b) {\n      return true;\n    }\n\n    if (\n      !isIterable(b) ||\n      a.size !== undefined && b.size !== undefined && a.size !== b.size ||\n      a.__hash !== undefined && b.__hash !== undefined && a.__hash !== b.__hash ||\n      isKeyed(a) !== isKeyed(b) ||\n      isIndexed(a) !== isIndexed(b) ||\n      isOrdered(a) !== isOrdered(b)\n    ) {\n      return false;\n    }\n\n    if (a.size === 0 && b.size === 0) {\n      return true;\n    }\n\n    var notAssociative = !isAssociative(a);\n\n    if (isOrdered(a)) {\n      var entries = a.entries();\n      return b.every(function(v, k)  {\n        var entry = entries.next().value;\n        return entry && is(entry[1], v) && (notAssociative || is(entry[0], k));\n      }) && entries.next().done;\n    }\n\n    var flipped = false;\n\n    if (a.size === undefined) {\n      if (b.size === undefined) {\n        if (typeof a.cacheResult === 'function') {\n          a.cacheResult();\n        }\n      } else {\n        flipped = true;\n        var _ = a;\n        a = b;\n        b = _;\n      }\n    }\n\n    var allEqual = true;\n    var bSize = b.__iterate(function(v, k)  {\n      if (notAssociative ? !a.has(v) :\n          flipped ? !is(v, a.get(k, NOT_SET)) : !is(a.get(k, NOT_SET), v)) {\n        allEqual = false;\n        return false;\n      }\n    });\n\n    return allEqual && a.size === bSize;\n  }\n\n  createClass(Repeat, IndexedSeq);\n\n    function Repeat(value, times) {\n      if (!(this instanceof Repeat)) {\n        return new Repeat(value, times);\n      }\n      this._value = value;\n      this.size = times === undefined ?

Among\n * other things, this allows you to animate CSS properties.  For example, you\n * can do this:\n *\n *     var tweenable = new Tweenable();\n *     tweenable.tween({\n *       from: { transform: 'translateX(45px)' },\n *       to: { transform: 'translateX(90xp)' }\n *     });\n *\n * `translateX(45)` will be tweened to `translateX(90)`.  To demonstrate:\n *\n *     var tweenable = new Tweenable();\n *     tweenable.tween({\n *       from: { transform: 'translateX(45px)' },\n *       to: { transform: 'translateX(90px)' },\n *       step: function (state) {\n *         console.log(state.transform);\n *       }\n *     });\n *\n * The above snippet will log something like this in the console:\n *\n *     translateX(60.3px)\n *     ...\n *     translateX(76.05px)\n *     ...\n *     translateX(90px)\n *\n * Another use for this is animating colors:\n *\n *     var tweenable = new Tweenable();\n *     tweenable.tween({\n *       from: { color: 'rgb(0,255,0)' },\n *       to: { color: 'rgb(255,0,255)' },\n *       step: function (state) {\n *         console.log(state.color);\n *       }\n *     });\n *\n * The above snippet will log something like this:\n *\n *     rgb(84,170,84)\n *     ...\n *     rgb(170,84,170)\n *     ...\n *     rgb(255,0,255)\n *\n * This extension also supports hexadecimal colors, in both long (`#ff00ff`)\n * and short (`#f0f`) forms.  Be aware that hexadecimal input values will be\n * converted into the equivalent RGB output values.  This is done to optimize\n * for performance.\n *\n *     var tweenable = new Tweenable();\n *     tweenable.tween({\n *       from: { color: '#0f0' },\n *       to: { color: '#f0f' },\n *       step: function (state) {\n *         console.log(state.color);\n *       }\n *     });\n *\n * This snippet will generate the same output as the one before it because\n * equivalent values were supplied (just in hexadecimal form rather than RGB):\n *\n *     rgb(84,170,84)\n *     ...\n *     rgb(170,84,170)\n *     ...\n *     rgb(255,0,255)\n *\n * ## Easing support\n *\n * Easing works somewhat differently in the Token extension.  This is because\n * some CSS properties have multiple values in them, and you might need to\n * tween each value along its own easing curve.  A basic example:\n *\n *     var tweenable = new Tweenable();\n *     tweenable.tween({\n *       from: { transform: 'translateX(0px) translateY(0px)' },\n *       to: { transform:   'translateX(100px) translateY(100px)' },\n *       easing: { transform: 'easeInQuad' },\n *       step: function (state) {\n *         console.log(state.transform);\n *       }\n *     });\n *\n * The above snippet will create values like this:\n *\n *     translateX(11.56px) translateY(11.56px)\n *     ...\n *     translateX(46.24px) translateY(46.24px)\n *     ...\n *     translateX(100px) translateY(100px)\n *\n * In this case, the values for `translateX` and `translateY` are always the\n * same for each step of the tween, because they have the same start and end\n * points and both use the same easing curve.  We can also tween `translateX`\n * and `translateY` along independent curves:\n *\n *     var tweenable = new Tweenable();\n *     tweenable.tween({\n *       from: { transform: 'translateX(0px) translateY(0px)' },\n *       to: { transform:   'translateX(100px) translateY(100px)' },\n *       easing: { transform: 'easeInQuad bounce' },\n *       step: function (state) {\n *         console.log(state.transform);\n *       }\n *     });\n *\n * The above snippet will create values like this:\n *\n *     translateX(10.89px) translateY(82.35px)\n *     ...\n *     translateX(44.89px) translateY(86.73px)\n *     ...\n *     translateX(100px) translateY(100px)\n *\n * `translateX` and `translateY` are not in sync anymore, because `easeInQuad`\n * was specified for `translateX` and `bounce` for `translateY`.  Mixing and\n * matching easing curves can make for some interesting motion in your\n * animations.\n *\n * The order of the space-separated easing curves correspond the token values\n * they apply to.  If there are more token values than easing curves listed,\n * the last easing curve listed is used.\n * @submodule Tweenable.token\n */\n\n// token function is defined above only so that dox-foundation sees it as\n// documentation and renders it.
